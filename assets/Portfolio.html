            <p>
                Hello Web People!!! My name is Andres Portillo. I'm a thrity year old, who is married and I want to introduce
                myself to you guys. I have work as an electrician for the pass thirteen years and now I'm looking forward
                to exploring what this side of the internet is all about. I'm someone who enjoy challenges, Therefore my current and past
                bosses have been able to rely on me . I don't like to give up on the first sign of
                trouble I gotta admit I had lost a few times but thats the beauty of why I enjoy electrical. It came to the point
                where I feel that there is more in me than just doing electrical, That does not mean im trying to say electrical is easy but it wasn't challeging me anymore.
                Also, I hate being bored at home and not being able to have some type of challenge throughout my day. I also happen to realized 
                that I enjoy solving stuff within my brain and thats one of the
                things most coworker didn't had and they would love to tackle project head on and will realize mid way they
                were wrong. I know that I probably didnt get to learn everything in electrical but I am ready to be able to take on this new challange and learn as much as 
                I can.I can promise you that with me around I wont quit till we find a solution
